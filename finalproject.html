        <summary>My Childhood</summary>
        <p>I grow up in Terengganu, southeast of Peninsular Malaysia. I lived near the river so I often spend my time swimming.
            I was never literally away from home except those two years when I stay in the hostel since I would have a class until late night
            to prepare for the examination.

        <summary>My Adulthood</summary>
        <p>As I grow up, I went on to pursue my graduate study in Aerospace Engineering. I spent almost 4 and a half years away from home
            and soon after I got a job with Malaysia Airlines. Though it was a contract job I am grateful since there was the beginning of everything,
            the beginning of who I am today.
